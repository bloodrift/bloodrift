Welcome to the website of Bloodrift.

Bloodrift is a game created by two students from SJTU.

It talks about the story of blood cells. They are too boring to drift in human vessels everyday. So they create two kinds of games for entertainment in their spare time.

# Endless Racing
  The first kind of game is endless racing. The rule for blood cells are simple. They needs to run as far as they can in vessels, at the same time, avoiding collision with virus and vessels, eating as much ATP as they can to gain energy, and also eating hemoglobin to replenish blood lost when they got hurt by collision.
  Players in this mode use W/S/A/D to control blood cells to go Up/Down/Left/Right.

# Speed Racing
  The second kind of game is speed racing. In this mode, the blood cell controlled by our player attend a racing game togather with other 7 fellow cells. The rules for them are also super simple -- run as much fast as they can to get No.1 in the end. They can also get help from collecting energy by eating ATPs. When being full with enery, they can rush with the highest speed in several seconds.
  Players management more things in this mode. They still use WSAD to control blood cells to go Up/Down/Left/Right, they could also use J/K to increase/decrease the speed the cell have.
